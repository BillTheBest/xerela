=head1 NAME

Xerela::SafeCopy

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Xerela::SafeCopy;
	Xerela::SafeCopy::safe_copy($originalFilename, $destinationFilename);
	Xerela::SafeCopy::safe_delete($filename);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is designed to be used by many processed that want to copy and later delete the same file.

Do not use this module unless you plan on copying and then deleting a file after you are finished with it.

=head2 METHODS

=over 12

=item C<safe_copy($originalFilename, $destinationFilename)>

Copies a file from $originalFilename to the $destinationFilename.  

If the file already exists in the $destinationFilename this method won't copy the 
file.  Instead it will update some metadata on the file letting other processes that
call C<safe_delete> know that the file is in use and not ready to be deleted.

=item C<safe_delete($filename)>

Deletes the file if there are no more users of it, i.e. everyone else that called
C<safe_copy> have also called C<safe_delete>.
