The package contains the Scheduler component used within the Xerela Server.  The public
API is described by the <code>IScheduler</code> interface and it's associated dependent
objects.  The public remote SOAP API is generated from the <code>IScheduler</code>
interface, however the Scheduler is available "in-process" by looking the Scheduler up
in the OSGi service registry.
<p>
The following code snippet demonstrates acquiring a reference to the Scheduler through
the OSGi framework.  We strongly recommend using an OSGi <code>ServiceTracker</code>
(not shown here) to manage your service references, rather than acquiring them directly
as in this example.
<p>
<pre>
   private IScheduler scheduler;
   ...
   public void start(BundleContext context)
   {
      ServiceReference ref = context.getServiceReference(IScheduler.class.getName());
      scheduler = (IScheduler) context.getService(ref);
      ...
   }
</pre>
</body>
