/**
 * A class providing a pool of PerlServer instances.  The pool has the following properties:
 * 
 * 1) Once filled, the pool will maintain at least a minimum number of instances in the pool.
 * 2) The pool is unbounded in the number of instances it will give out, but bounded in the
 *    number of instances allowed back in the pool.
 * 3) Once filled to a maximum level, all returning instances to the pool are discarded.
 * 4) If the pool has more than the minimum number of instances, but less than the maximum
 *    level, a returning Perl will "linger" for a short time.  If it is unused during that
 *    time, it will be discarded.  But not if it would take the pool below the mimimum level
 *    (see (1) above).
 * 5) A Perl script that uses a PerlServer cannot run any longer than defined by the 
 *    'maxPerlLifeSeconds'.  By default this value is 1800 (30 minutes).  By setting this
 *    value to '0' PerlServer instances will never timeout.  Only do this if you are
 *    sure that you will have forever running Perls.
 *
 * The "lingering" behavior of the pool provides very good throughput when a large number of
 * PerlServers are needed for a sustained duration of time.  At the same time, it allows the
 * pool to shrink to its minimum size once the demand drops off.
 *
 * The pool has a number of configurable parameters controlled by system properties:
 * 
 * minPerlPoolSize       - the minimum number of instances to keep in the pool
 * lingerPerlPoolSize    - the maximum number of instances allowed in the pool
 * perlLingerTimeSeconds - the length of time an idle server will stay in the pool
 * maxUseThreshold       - the maximum number of times to use a PerlServer before discarding
 * debugPerlPool         - the level of detail in logging desired (0-3).  0 being none.
 * maxPerlLifeSeconds    - the number of seconds that any single Perl script is allowed to run.

     * A helper method used to create a new PerlServer.  It will try three times, with a
     * 100ms sleep in between, to successfuly create a PerlServer.  We have to do this
     * because constructing a PerlServer spawns an instance of a Perl processa and under
     * Windows this is a dicey proposition.  We have several challenges.
     * 
     * 1) Sometimes when spawning processes too fast we get this native error from Java:
     *       IOException: CreateProcess: perl -I. -I. .\PerlServer.pl error=5
     * 2) Sometimes the process spawns [apparently] successfully, but subsequently fails a
     *    test to see whether it is alive.  Possibly this is a Java issue.
     *
     * The first is hard to know whether to blame the OS or Perl's DLL initialization.  The
     * second is a race condition that is problematic across the Windows platform.  When
     * creating a process, the OS allocates the process, creates a thread and schedules it
     * to run, and then returns immediately.  At that point the process has not run through
     * it's shared library initialization.  From the user's perspective, the process is off
     * and running (the launch call returned without error).  The reality is that the 
     * process may fail to initialize and start.  Windows provides no method to determine
     * whether a process is running, other than polling it's state; and sometimes polling
     * its state immediately after launch spuriously indicates that the process is dead.
     * More information can be found here (read the discussion comments):
     * 
     *   http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/01/19/356048.aspx
     *
     * Suffice it to say that there are a myriad of ways in which creating the process
     * can fail sporadically in a way that may not and probably will not occur on the
     * next attempt to create that same exact process.  As a result, our blunt three-try
     * logic has eliminated all (or nearly all) observed sporadic launch failures.
