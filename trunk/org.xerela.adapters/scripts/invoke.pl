=head1 NAME

invoke.pl - Invokes an adapter operation using the Xerela Perl Adapter SDK.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    invoke.pl <adapter_package> <operation_name> [-i <input-file>]|[-x <contents>]
    invoke.pl Xerela::Adapters::Cisco::IOS backup operationInput.xml

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<invoke.pl> Perl script invokes an operation for a specified adapter using the Xerela Perl Adapter SDK.  This achieved
by specifying the package name of the adapter module to be used, the name of the operation that will be invoked, and either
file location string or the actual contents of an XML document that acts as the input for specified operation.

The C<invoke.pl> Perl script is considered to be the main entry point for any operation when invoked by Xerela.  Once
the package name of the Xerela adapter module is determined, the C<invoke.pl> Perl script will execute the subroutine that
implements the operation of the same name.  If the operation encounters any errors, the C<invoke.pl> Perl script will die
with a message containing the error that occurred.

=head2 Adapter Package Name/ID

The name/id of the Xerela adapter that contains the operation that will be executed.  The name/id of a Xerela adapter
is the full package name of the Perl module that implements the adapter.  For example, the Xerela adapter that implements
support for the Cisco IOS device family has the adapter name/id of C<Xerela::Adapters::Cisco::IOS>.  The reason the package
name is used as the name/id of a Xerela adapter is to easily call any operations that are implemented on the adapter module
itself.  It is expected that the adapter ID/name match both the name of the Xerela adapter module and that "adapterId" element defined within
the metadata XML used to define an adapter (the meta data file for an adapter I<ALWAYS> exists within the same directory as the
Xerela adapter module itself).

=head2 Operation Name

The name of the operation that will be invoked.  This name refers to a subroutine that is implemented on the specified
adapter module that can be invoked; the specified operation B<MUST> be implemented on the Xerela adapter module
that is referenced by the specified adapter name/id, otherwise an error will occur when attempting to invoke the operation.

An example of a valid operation name is C<backup> when used with the C<Xerela::Adapters::Cisco::IOS> adapter module.  This
means that the C<backup> subroutine on the C<Xerela::Adapters::Cisco::IOS> adapter module will be the operation that is
invoked.

=head2 Operation Input XML

INPUT XML INFO GOES HERE!

=item C<usage()>

Prints the usage message for using the C<invoke.pl> Perl script if invalid arguments are passed in.
