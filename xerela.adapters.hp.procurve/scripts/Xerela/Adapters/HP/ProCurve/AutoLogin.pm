# Connects to and authenticates with a ProCurve device that is being connected to by a specified CLIProtocol implementation.
# Attempt to handle all of the edge cases that are encountered and successfully put the ProCurve device into
# enable mode.  If all is successful, the device prompt is parsed out and is returned to be used as the primary
# regular expression to wait for when sending commands.
#
# Input:	$cli_protocol -	The CLIProtocol object that is being used to communicate with the device.
#			$connection_path -	Reference to a Xerela::ConnectionPath object that contains the IP address
#								and any credentials that would need to be used for the current connection.

# Returns:	The regular expression that will match the device's enable mode prompt that was found.

=head1 NAME

Xerela::Adapters::HP::ProCurve::AutoLogin - Automates the connection and authentication with an HP ProCurve device.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Xerela::Adapters::HP::ProCurve::AutoLogin;
	my $cli_protocol = Xerela::CLIProtocolFactory::create( $connection_path );
	my $prompt_regex = Xerela::Adapters::HP::ProCurve::AutoLogin::execute( $cli_protocol, $connection_path );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The autologin module for an adapter provides an abstract sequence of commands and responses
that allow the user to login to the device.  Usually this is via a CLI protocol such as Telnet
or SSH.  Once fully connected and authenticated with the device, the autologin module must be able
to calculate and return the a regular expression that will be leveraged by users of the module
to match the primary prompt for the device.  This is crucial in being able to send commands and wait
for their responses where leveraging the command line interface (CLI) clients provided by the Xerela
Perl framework, such as C<Xerela::Telnet> and C<Xerela::SSH>.

This module should be able to handle all the possible scenarios that might be encountered when
connecting to and authenticating with a device.

The autologin module should be abstract enough that scripts outside of the adapters can use it
as well.  For example, a script to make mass changes to a device should be able to leverage
the autologin sequence just like an adapter does during backup.

=head1 PUBLIC SUB-ROUTINES

=over 12

=item C<execute($cli_protocol, $connection_path)>

The main entry point for connecting to and authenticating with a network device.  This sub-routine
will connect to the device using the specified C<Xerela::CLIProtocol> object as the command line interface (CLI)
client and using the hostname or IP address specified within the C<Xerela::ConnectionPath> object.

This method must return a regular expression that can be used to match the primary prompt of the device that
has been connected to.  This is required so that users of the autologin module can have a way to match the
prompt after sending a command to a device and waiting for the response.

=back

=head1 PRIVATE SUB-ROUTINES

=over 12

=item C<_inital_connection($cli_protocol, $connection_path)>

Once an inital connection has been established with the network device, the first text response over the CLI is
examined.  Depending on the response, various sub-routines may be called.

=item C<_send_press_any_key($cli_protocol, $connection_path)>

This sub-routine is called if a response from the device indicates that any input should be sent to the
device.  This will cause newline to be sent to the device.

=item C<_send_username($cli_protocol, $connection_path)>

This sub-routine is called if a response from the device indicates that the "username" credential should be sent to the
device.

=item C<_send_username_again($cli_protocol, $connection_path)>

This sub-routine is called if a response from the device indicates that the "username" credential should be sent again to the
device.

=item C<_send_enable_username($cli_protocol, $connection_path)>

This sub-routine is called if a response from the device indicates that the "username" credential after the "enable" command
has been sent to the device.

=item C<_send_password($cli_protocol, $connection_path)>

This sub-routine is called if a response from the device indicates that the "password" credential should be sent to the
device.

=item C<_send_enable($cli_protocol, $connection_path)>

This sub-routine is called if we have reached the normal device prompt.  Since the ProCurve adapter relies on commands to be
called that can only be called from enabled mode, the "enable" command will be sent to the device so that we may attempt to
enter the enabled mode.

=item C<_send_enable_password($cli_protocol, $connection_path)>

This sub-routine is called if a response from the device indicates that the "enablePassword" credential should be sent to the
device so that we may attempt to enter the enabled mode.  This most likely to happen after the "enable" command has been
sent to the device.

=item C<_calculate_prompt_regex($cli_protocol, $connection_path)>

This sub-routine is called once the device has been connected to and authentication has completed successfully.  The
last match from the device will be examined the primary prompt will be parsed from it and converted into a regular
expression that can be used to match the prompt of the device.  This regular expression will be returned so that it can
be used by it's caller.
