=head1 NAME

Xerela::SCP - SCP client implementation of the Xerela::TransferProtocol interface/abstract base class.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Xerela::TransferProtocol;
	use Xerela::TransferProtocolFactory;

	my $xfer_client = Xerela::TransferProtocolFactory::create("SCP");
	$xfer_client->connect("10.10.10.10", 22, somename, somepassword);
	$xfer_client->put("test.txt", "test.txt");
	$xfer_client->disconnect();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Xerela::SCP represents a client implementing the SCP protocol that adheres to the interface specified by the
Xerela::TransferProtocol class.  The core backing of this implementation is provided by the PSCP executable.
PSCP is PuTTY's secure copy client and was chosen for the fact that it can be compiled to work on all of the operating
systems supported by the Xerela framework.

It is assumed that the PSCP executable is located within the system path and is accessible to any Perl code that may
utilize the C<Xerela::SCP> module.  If PSCP is not located within the system path, then an error will occur when any file
transfer is attempted using C<Xerela::SCP> module.

In order to conform to the interface provided by Xerela::TransferProtocol, the following functionality
had to be implemented:  connecting to a remote server (this is supported by the C<connect> method), disconnecting
from a remote server (this is supported by the C<disconnect> method), retrieve/get a file from the server and
store it locally (this is supported by the C<get> method), and send/put a local file to the server (this is
supported by the C<put> method).

=head1 IMPLEMENTED METHODS

The following methods are all methods that have been implemented according to the abstract/interface methods that have been
specified in the C<Xerela::TransferProtocol> module.

=over 12

=item C<connect($ip_address, $port, $username, $password)>

Stores various information needed by the PSCP program to authenticate and connect to a device when performing a file transfer
action.  No explicit connection takes place: that only happens with calls to C<get($remote_file, $local_file)> and
C<put($local_file, $remote_file)>.

$ip_address -	The hostname/IP address of the server.

$port -			The port to connect to on the server.

$username -		The username credential to use against the server.

$password -		Optional.  The password credential to use against the server.  If the local machine has a key to automate
				authentication to the device, that will be used.

=item C<disconnect()>

Since the SCP protocol does necessitate a need to disconnect to the server, the C<disconnect()> method serves simply as a
clean up method for any lingering PSCP process.  If a PSCP process still exists that was spawned by this C<Xerela::SCP> object,
it will be killed.

=item C<get($remote_file, $local_file)>

Retrieves a remote file from the host/IP address that this this C<Xerela::SCP> object is aware of.

$remote_file -	A relative or absolute filepath on the host/server defining the file to be retrieved.
				If the filepath is relative, it is then relative to the default directory of the host/server.

$local_file -	Optional.  A filepath where the remote file should be transfer to on the local machine.
				This file path can either absolute or relative.  If the filepath is not specified, then the file
				name of the remote file being retrieved will be used and placed within the current working directory
				on the local machine.  The current working directory will also be used as the relative directory if
				the local file name is not absolute.

Returns I<true> if the file transfer was successful; I<false> otherwise.

=item C<put($local_file, $remote_file)>

Sends a local file to the host/IP address that this C<Xerela::SCP> object is aware of.

$local_file -	A filepath defining of the local file to put on the host/server.  This file path can either absolute or
				relative.  If the filepath is relative, then it is relative to the current working directory.

$remote_file -	Optional.  A filepath defining where the local file should be transfer to on the host/server.
				This file path can either absolute or relative.  If the filepath is not specified, then the file
				name of the local file being sent will be used and placed within the default directory of the host/server.

Returns I<true> if the file transfer was successful; I<false> otherwise.

=item C<pscp($source, $target)>

Invokes a PSCP process to perform a file transfer between a specifed source and target.  Both the C<get($remote_file, $local_file)>
and C<put($local_file, $remote_file)> methods call this method after constructing the necessary source and target arguments.

It is assumed that the PSCP executable is located within the system path and is accesible to the Perl script
utilizing this C<Xerela::SCP> object.  If PSCP is not located within the system path, then an error will occur.

If the PSCP process successfully performs the file transfer, I<true> will be returned; I<false> otherwise.

The PSCP process is invoked with the following flags: 

	-V        print version information and exit
	-pgpfp    print PGP key fingerprints and exit
	-p        preserve file attributes
	-q        quiet, don't show statistics
	-r        copy directories recursively
	-v        show verbose messages
	-load sessname  Load settings from saved session
	-P port   connect to specified port
	-l user   connect with specified username
	-pw passw login with specified password
	-1 -2     force use of particular SSH protocol version
	-4 -6     force use of IPv4 or IPv6
	-C        enable compression
	-i key    private key file for authentication
	-noagent  disable use of Pageant
	-agent    enable use of Pageant
	-batch    disable all interactive prompts
	-unsafe   allow server-side wildcards (DANGEROUS)
	-sftp     force use of SFTP protocol
	-scp      force use of SCP protocol

Here is an example of the the PSCP command that is executed:

pscp -v -scp -l someUser -pw somePassword -P 22 10.10.10.1:remotefile.txt localfile.txt

pscp -v -scp -l someUser -pw somePassword -P 22 localfile.txt 10.10.10.1:remotefile.txt

=item C<_log_and_kill_pscp($error_message, $pscp_error_stream)>

Logs a specified error message and the assumed PSCP error stream using the C<Xerela::Logger> singleton and kills
the currently running PSCP process.  This method should only be used if an error was encountered and that error
should be logged before the Perl and PSCP processes are killed.

=back

=head1 INHERITED METHODS

The following methods are all methods that have been inherited from the C<Xerela::TransferProtocol> module.

=over 12

=item C<get_ip_address()>

Retrieves the hostname/IP address of the server that the implementation of the Xerela::TransferProtocol
class is connected to.

=item C<get_protocol_name()>

Retrieves the name of the transfer protocol that this implementation of the Xerela::TransferProtocol
class represents.  For example: "SCP".

=item C<get_port()>

Retrieves the port that this implementation of the Xerela::TransferProtocol
class has connected to on the server.

=item C<get_timeout()>

Retrieves the length (in seconds) that this implementation of the Xerela::TransferProtocol class
should wait for the server during a transfer before a time-out error is declared.

=item C<set_timeout($timeout)>

Sets the length (in seconds) that this implementation of the Xerela::TransferProtocol class
should wait for the server during a transfer before a time-out error is declared.
