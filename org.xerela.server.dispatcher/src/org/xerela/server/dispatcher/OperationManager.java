/**
 * The central class for submitting arbitrary tasks to be run by a pool of available
 * threads in round-robin fashion.
 * <p>
 * The primary interfaces to the class are:
 * <p>
 * <li><code>submitJobs()</code>: give a list of ITasks (essentially Runnables with
 * a lock object), an indicator of whether they must be executed sequentially or not,
 * and a listener to be notified of progress on the supplied tasks. Right now, the
 * only notification that will come is when the task completes. This returns an ID
 * for the batch.</li>
 * 
 * <li><code>cancelJobs()</code>: Given a batch ID, will cancel all of the jobs that
 * have not yet run, and will attempt to cancel those currently running.</li>
 * 
 * <li><code>resubmitJob()</code>: Attempt to resubmit the specified job to the
 * OperationManager to be run again. The only time this is guaranteed to work is
 * during a notification callback in supplied listener.</li>
 * 
 * <li><code>getStatus()</code>: Return an object describing the OperationManager's
 * current activity.</li>
