=head1 NAME

Xerela::Logger - Logging utility used exclusively by the Xerela Perl Adapter SDK to log debug and fatal messages.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Xerela::Logger;

	my $logger = Xerela::Logger::get_logger();
	$logger->enable_logging_to_file($adapter_id, $operation_name, $ip_address);
	$logger->debug("Test debug message");
	$logger->set_logging_level(1);
	$logger->fatal("Something extremely bad happened, so we are dying.");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Xerela::Logger> is a simple logging utility that is used exclusively by the Xerela Perl Adapter SDK to log debug or fatal
messages or events to C<STDERR> or to a file on the local file system.  Implementing a singleton pattern, a call to the
C<get_logger()> method will either create or return the existing singleton of the C<Xerela::Logger> module.  By default,
all logging will happen to C<STDERR>, but logging to a file can be enabled via the
C<enable_logging_to_file($adapter_id, $operation_name, $ip_address)> method.  This method will attempt to set up logging to
a file by checking to see if C<ADAPTER_LOG_TO_FILE> environment variable exists and is set to a true value.  If this is the
case, then the C<ADAPTER_LOG_DIR> environment variable will be checked for a directory to write the file to.
If the C<ADAPTER_LOG_TO_FILE> environment variable does not exist or does not contain anything, then all logged messages will
be sent to C<STDERR>.  If everything is satisfied, then a file with the syntax of $adapter_id_$operation_name_$ip_address.log
will be use as the log file and will be written to the directory specified.

There are two ways to use the logger: Either you can simply log messages a file using the C<debug($message, $context)> 
method, or you can log an fatal message to the log and have the Perl process exited by using the C<fatal($message, $context)>.

You can also determine whether or not to display debug log messages by setting a logging level.  If the logging level is
less than or equal to zero (0), then both DEBUG and FATAL messages will be logged; otherwise, only FATAL messages will be
logged.  The logging level can be set in two ways: either programatically using the C<set_logging_level($logging_level)>
method, or through the "ADAPTER_LOGGING_LEVEL" environment variable.  If set programatically, the value will override the one
that may be specified through the "ADAPTER_LOGGING_LEVEL" environment variable.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=over 12

=item C<get_logger()>

If a singleton instance of the C<Xerela::Logger> class has not been created, then it will be.  Otherwise,
the existing singleton object will be returned.  When created for the first time, the singleton will default to logging
to C<STDERR>.  Logging to a file can be enabled via the C<enable_logging_to_file($adapter_id, $operation_name, $ip_address)>
method.  Also, the "ADAPTER_LOGGING_LEVEL" environment variable will be examined to see if it exists and if it contains anything
valid; if so, this will be the logging level used - otherwise, the logging level will default to zero (0), enabling both
DEBUG and FATAL messages.

=item C<_trim($string)>

Trims any white space that is at the start and end of a specified string.

=back

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=over 12

=item C<enable_logging_to_file($adapter_id, $operation_name, $ip_address)>

Attempts to set up logging to a file by checking to see if C<ADAPTER_LOG_TO_FILE> environment variable exists and is set to a true value.  If this is the
case, then the C<ADAPTER_LOG_DIR> environment variable will be checked for a directory to write the file to.
If the C<ADAPTER_LOG_TO_FILE> environment variable does not exist or does not contain anything, then all logged messages will
be sent to C<STDERR>.  If everything is satisfied, then a file with the syntax of $adapter_id_$operation_name_$ip_address.log
will be use as the log file and will be written to the directory specified.

There are a few caveats associated with the directory:

=over

=item *

The directory can either be absolute or relative.

=over

=item *

If the directory is absolute, then all of the directories that are encountered within the directory path B<must> exist.

=item *

If the directory is relative, then it will be assumed to be relative to the current working directory of Perl, which is 
typically the same directory of the main Perl script that is being executed.

=back

=back

If the log file that is being written already exists, then new logging messages will be appended to the end of the existing
log file.  Otherwise, a new file will be created for logging.

=item C<set_logging_level($logging_level)>

Sets the logging level for this singleton instance of the C<Xerela::Logger> module.  Currently, any logging level less than
or equal to zero (0) means that both DEBUG and FATAL messages will be logged.  Any logging level greater than 0 will disable
DEBUG logging so that only FATAL messages are logged.  The specified value will override the one that may be specified
through the "ADAPTER_LOGGING_LEVEL" environment variable.

=item C<debug($message, $context)>

Logs a message to the file handle that this C<Xerela::Logger> singleton instance knows of.  You can also determine whether or
not to display debug log messages by setting a logging level.  If the logging level is less than or equal to zero (0), then
both DEBUG and FATAL messages will be logged; otherwise, only FATAL messages will be logged.  The logging level can be set in
two ways: either programatically using the C<set_logging_level($logging_level)> method, or through the
"ADAPTER_LOGGING_LEVEL" environment variable.  If set programatically, the value will override the one that may be specified
through the "ADAPTER_LOGGING_LEVEL" environment variable.

The syntax of a logged message is as follows:  1) A time stamp for when the message was received, 2) A context for the
logged message, and 3) The actual message to be logged.

The C<$context> parameter is optional and if it is not specified, than the the package name of the module that
called C<debug($message, $context)> will be used.  Providing an explicit context can be useful if you are trying to 
group and/or filter log messages from various modules that are performing actions for the same purpose/context.

B<NOTE:> If the C<Xerela::Logger> object calling C<debug($message, $context)> does not have a valid file handle to a log file,
then all logged messages will be sent to C<STDERR>.

B<SPECIAL NOTE:> If the Xerela PerlServer for BSF has been used to invoke the perl process that is using C<Xerela::Logger>, 
then we must prepend the special identifier "=== ps log" to any messages that are considered logging messages.
We can check to see if this is the case by examining the "__GUID" environment variable. If it exist, we will assume that
PerlServer is being used. Also, the log message will be Base64 encoded using C<MIME::Base64::encode_base64>.
The purpose of this encoding is to not interfere with any parsing done in PerlServer.  The Base64 encoded text will also
be joined by replacing the newlines to represent one long string and not be split up across multiple lines since
Xerela's PerlServer can only read a line at a time.

=item C<fatal($message, $context)>

Similar to C<debug($message)> but will end the Perl process with a call to C<Carp::croak> with the error message specified.
This is useful if a situation has occurred in your program and you want to log what happens before you quit out.

To help figure out why the error occurred, output similar to C<Carp::croak> with the error message along with a
stacktrace will be logged.

The C<$context> parameter is optional and if it is not specified, than the the package name of the module that
called C<fatal> will be used.  Providing an explicit context can be useful if you are trying to to group and/or
filter log messages from various modules that are performing actions for the same purpose/context.

NOTE: If the C<Xerela::Logger> object calling C<fatal> does not have a valid file handle to a log file,
then the message will be logged to C<STDERR> and a call to C<Carp::croak> with the message will still occur.

=item C<fatal_error_code($errorCode, $ip, $actualResponse, $context)>

This method is simply a wrapper around the C<fatal($message, $context)> method.  It formats a readable error message that
can be consistent across all Xerela Perl operations.

The C<$errorCode> parameter should be a well known error code taken from this modules 'our' variables.  For example
'$TFTP_ERROR'.

The C<$ip> parameter is an IP address of a device.  This makes its way into the fatal log message.

The C<$actualResponse> parameter is the actual response from the device, assuming the adapter failed and has some response
that would help the user solve the issue.

The C<$context> parameter is optional.  See C<fatal($message, $context)> for information on this variable.
