The classes in this package implement an NIO agent framework.  This framework
uses Java NIO to scale to the order of thousands of concurrent connections.  All
of the classes in this package are protocol agnostic.  Protocol's implemented on
top of datagram, socket, and pipe channels can all reuse these classes.
