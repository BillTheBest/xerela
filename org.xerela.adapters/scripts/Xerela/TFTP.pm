=head1 NAME

Xerela::TFTP - TFTP client implementation of the Xerela::TransferProtocol interface/abstract base class.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Xerela::TransferProtocol;
	use Xerela::TransferProtocolFactory;

	my $xfer_client = Xerela::TransferProtocolFactory::create("TFTP");
	$xfer_client->connect("10.10.10.10", 21);
	$xfer_client->put("test.txt", "test.txt");
	$xfer_client->disconnect();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Xerela::TFTP represents a client implementing the TFTP protocol that adheres to the interface specified by the
Xerela::TransferProtocol class.  The core backing of this implementation is the C<Net::TFTP> module.

In order to conform to the interface provided by Xerela::TransferProtocol, the following functionality
had to be implemented:  connecting to a remote server (this is supported by the C<connect> method), disconnecting
from a remote server (this is supported by the C<disconnect> method), retrieve/get a file from the server and
store it locally (this is supported by the C<get> method), and send/put a local file to the server (this is
supported by the C<put> method).

=head1 IMPLEMENTED METHODS

The following methods are all methods that have been implemented according to the abstract/interface methods that have been
specified in the C<Xerela::TransferProtocol> module.

=over 12

=item C<connect($ip_address, $port, $username, $password)>

Since the TFTP protocol does necessitate a need to connect to the server, the C<connect($ip_address, $port, $username, $password)>
method will simply create a new C<Net::TFTP> object with the IP address and port specified.  The username and password credentials
are ignored since there is no verification on a TFTP server.

$ip_address -	The hostname/IP address of the server.

$port -			The port to connect to on the server.

$username -		Ignored by this implementation.

$password -		Ignored by this implementation.
	
=item C<disconnect()>

Since the TFTP protocol does necessitate a need to disconnect to the server, the C<disconnect()> method has no functionality
in this case.  A true value will be returned.

=item C<get($remote_file, $local_file)>

Retrieves a file from the remote host/IP address that this Xerela::TransferProtocol is connected to.

$remote_file -	A relative or absolute filepath on the host/server defining the file to be retrieved.
				If the filepath is relative, it is then relative to the default directory of the host/server.

$local_file -	Optional.  A filepath where the remote file should be transfer to on the local machine.
				This file path can either absolute or relative.  If the filepath is not specified, then the file
				name of the remote file being retrieved will be used and placed within the current working directory
				on the local machine.  The current working directory will also be used as the relative directory if
				the local file name is not absolute.

Returns I<true> if the file transfer was successful; I<false> otherwise.

=item C<put($local_file, $remote_file)>

Sends a file to the remote host/IP address that this Xerela::TransferProtocol is connected to.

$local_file -	A filepath defining of the local file to put on the host/server.  This file path can either absolute or
				relative.  If the filepath is relative, then it is relative to the current working directory.

$remote_file -	Optional.  A filepath defining where the local file should be transfer to on the host/server.
				This file path can either absolute or relative.  If the filepath is not specified, then the file
				name of the local file being sent will be used and placed within the default directory of the host/server.

Returns I<true> if the file transfer was successful; I<false> otherwise.

=head1 INHERITED METHODS

The following methods are all methods that have been inherited from the C<Xerela::TransferProtocol> module.

=over 12

=item C<get_ip_address()>

Retrieves the hostname/IP address of the server that the implementation of the Xerela::TransferProtocol
class is connected to.

=item C<get_protocol_name()>

Retrieves the name of the transfer protocol that this implementation of the Xerela::TransferProtocol
class represents.  For example: "TFTP".

=item C<get_port()>

Retrieves the port that this implementation of the Xerela::TransferProtocol
class has connected to on the server.

=item C<get_timeout()>

Retrieves the length (in seconds) that this implementation of the Xerela::TransferProtocol class
should wait for the server during a transfer before a time-out error is declared.

=item C<set_timeout($timeout)>

Sets the length (in seconds) that this implementation of the Xerela::TransferProtocol class
should wait for the server during a transfer before a time-out error is declared.
