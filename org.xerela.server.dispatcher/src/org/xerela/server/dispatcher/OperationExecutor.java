/**
 * A class for running <code>Operation</code>s. It implements a bounded pool of threads;
 * as <code>OperationBatch</code>es are submitted it will add threads to the pool until
 * the maximum number is reached. Once all existing <code>Operation</code>s have been
 * executed, each thread will wait for a specified period of time before exiting.
 * <p>
 * Once at least one thread is active, an internal monitoring thread will be created to
 * periodically check active threads. If a thread has been running long enough, it will
 * be interrupted and the <code>Operation</code> marked cancelled, and the thread moved
 * to a separate pool of inactive threads not counted against the active pool bound.
 * <p>
 * As cancelled threads continue to run they will be periodically interrupted by the
 * monitor thread; if they run long enough (more than twice the auto-cancel time) they
 * will be marked as zombie threads and have their priority reduced to the minimum allowed.
 * <p>
 * Every <code>OperationExecutor</code> is associated with a <code>OperationManager</code>
 * upon creation. As <code>Operation</code>s complete (or are cancelled internally), the
 * <code>OperationManager</code>'s <code>jobDone()</code> method will be called.
 * <p>
 * Threads will be named to reflect their current operational status. That breakdown is:
 * <p>
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Status</th>
 * <th>Name</th>
 * <th>Description</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>IDLE</td>
 * <td>Idle-#</td>
 * <td>A thread waiting for a new task</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>RUNNING</td>
 * <td>Running-#</td>
 * <td>Currently running a task</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>CANCELLED</td>
 * <td>CANCELLED-#</td>
 * <td>Cancelled either by calling code or by the internal monitor</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>ZOMBIE</td>
 * <td>ZOMBIE-#</td>
 * <td>A cancelled thread that will not die</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * In each case, # is the internal ID of the thread.
 * <p>
 * This class is intended to be thread safe.
