=head1 NAME

Xerela::Telnet - Telnet implementation of the Xerela::CLIProtocol interface/abstract class.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Xerela::CLIProtocol;
	use Xerela::CLIProtocolFactory;

	my $telnet = Xerela::CLIProtocolFactory->create("Telnet", "10.10.10.10", 22);
	$telnet->connect($telnet->get_ip_address(), $ssh->get_port());

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Xerela::Telnet> provides an Telnet implementation of the C<Xerela::CLIProtocol> interface/abstract class.
It leverages the implemented methods from C<Xerela::CLIProtocol> and utilizes the C<Net::Telnet>
module to provide Telnet-specifc support to the interface methods.

=head1 METHODS

Please refer to the "METHOD" section of the C<Xerela::CLIProtocol> documentation to know what methods
there are and how they are used.  Any additional documentation to methods that have their own unique
implementation for Telnet purposes will be documented below.

=over 12

=item C<new($ioHandle)>

Creates a new instance of the C<Xerela::Telnet> class with a default timeout value of 30 seconds.
While this constructor method can be called on its own, it is recommend that the C<Xerela::CLIProtocolFactory>
and its C<create> method be used for creating objects based off of the C<Xerela::CLIProtocol> class.

$ioHandle - an optional argument.  If an already open IO handle is provided, then the connect method will
			do nothing and all send and receive methods will read and write from the provided filehandle.

=item C<connect($ip_address, $port)>

Connects to a device at a specified IP address and port.  Although the interface specified by the 
C<Xerela::CLIProtocol> class specifies that C<connect()> also takes in a a username and password, these
are not need and not used by the C<Xerela::Telnet> implementation.

$ip_address -	The administrative IP address of the device.

$port -			The port to connect to on the device.

=item C<disconnect()>

Disconnects from the device this C<Xerela::Telnet> object is already connected to.

=item C<send($input)>

Sends an input string to the device.  In order to retrieve the output, it is expected that the user
will call C<wait_for()> method with a valid regular expression after the call to C<send()>.

=item C<put($input)>

Same as C<send> except that no line separator, e.g. a CRLF, is appended to the $input.

=item C<send_as_bytes($input)>

Converts an input string into a hexadecimal byte representation and sends it to the device.
Unlike C<send()>, C<send_as_bytes()> will not append any special CRLF character/bytes to the end of the input.
The input will simply be converted into hexadecimal and will be sent as is.  It is expected that the
command interpreter on the device should know how to handle the byte information coming in.

In order to retrieve the output, it is expected that the user will call C<wait_for()> with a valid regular 
expression after the call to C<send_as_bytes()>.

=item C<set_timeout($timeout)>

Set the length (in seconds) for how long the C<wait_for()> method should wait on a response from a
device before timing out.  This time out value will only be used if the the C<wait_for()> method is used
with the matching regular expression as its only parameter.

=item C<wait_for($regex, $timeout)>

Waits for the response from a device and checks to see if the response matches a specified regular expression.
If a match is found, all of the response preceeding AND including the match will be returned.  It is assumed
that this function will be called directly after a call to send().

$regex -	A valid regular expression to match the response from the device.

$timeout -	Optional.  Specifies the amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a response from the device.
			If this parameter is specified, the timeout specified by a call to C<set_timeout()> will be ignored
			for this function call only.

=item C<get_response($timeout)>

Waits a specified window of time for a response to come back from the device.  Given a window of time, if any data
is sent from the device, it will be collected and stored as part of the overall response from the device.  If the window
of time goes by without any response from the device, it is then assumed that the device is done responding and the
overall response will be returned.

The use of C<get_response($timeout)> might be desireable over C<wait_for($regex, $timeout)> if there is not a particular
part of the response from a device you are waiting for, or if the response from a device comes back in an unexpected
format/flow.

$timeout -	Optional; 5 seconds by default.  Specifies the a window of time (in seconds) to wait for a response
			from the device.
			
=item C<output_record_separator($charSequence)>

Set or get the output record separator.  The $charSequence argument is optional.  If no argument is given, this method
simply returns the current value of the output record separator, such as a CR or CRLF.

=item C<_log_and_die($error_message)>

B<NOTE:> This method is only used as a callback when C<Net::Telnet> encounters a fatal situation, instead of die-ing.

Invokes the the C<Xerela::Logger> singleton's C<fatal($message)> method with a specified error message.  This
method is used as a callback whenever C<Net::Telnet> encounters a fatal situation.  This is done by calling the
C<errmode($code_reference)> method on the C<Net::Telnet> instance; once registered, C<Net::Telnet> will call this method
with the error message it generated.
