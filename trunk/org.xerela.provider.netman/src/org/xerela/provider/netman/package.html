The package contains the Network Manager component used within the Xerela Server.  The
public API is described by the <code>INetworkManager</code> interface and it's associated
dependent objects.  The public remote SOAP API is generated from the <code>INetworkManager</code>
interface, however the Network Manager is available "in-process" by looking the 
INetworkManager up in the OSGi service registry.
<p>
The following code snippet demonstrates acquiring a reference to the Network Manager through
the OSGi framework.  We strongly recommend using an OSGi <code>ServiceTracker</code>
(not shown here) to manage your service references, rather than acquiring them directly
as in this example.
<p>
<pre>
   private INetworkManager netman;
   ...
   public void start(BundleContext context)
   {
      ServiceReference ref = context.getServiceReference(INetworkManager.class.getName());
      netman = (INetworkManagere) context.getService(ref);
      ...
   }
</pre>
