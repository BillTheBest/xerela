The classes in this package implement the TFTP protocol on top of the NIO agent
framework.  The implementation supports the block size option, and timeout
interval.  Runtime settings may be specified in a file named tftp.props in a
directory that is on the classpath.  The request packet's filename field will be
used to identify a file on the local filesystem to be used for producing or
consuming the bytes contained in the data packets.  This default behavior can be
overriden by implementing the DataConsumer and/or DataProducer interfaces.  When
a request is receieved a SecurityManager validates that the request should be
fullfilled.  If the request is denied then the server silently discards the
request.  The default implementation of SecurityManager simply checks that the
mode is octet, but it can be overriden.  An EventListener is used to field the
callbacks for asynchrous events (e.g. transfer initiated, transfer complete).
The callbacks include the local and remote socket address, so the various events
surrounding a transfer can be correlated.
