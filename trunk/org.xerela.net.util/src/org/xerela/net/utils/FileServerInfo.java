/**
 * The <code>FileServerInfo</code> represents a simple container to hold basic information about a file server.
 * This information includes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The name of the protocol that the file server utilizes for transferring files, such as "TFTP" or "FTP"
 * <li>The IP address of the machine running the file server.  If the file server is running locally and bound to an interface,
 * one should use the local IP address.
 * <li>The port value that the file server is bound to and that communication to and from it happens over.
 * <li>The absolute file path to the root directory of the file server.  The only caveat of this all is that it is assumed that
 * the root directory specified can be accessible by the machine running Xerela.  This means that either the file server must be
 * running on the same machine, or there must be a mapping to the directory located on the local file system.  If the latter is
 * the case, then the root directory should be this mapped directory.
 * </ul>
