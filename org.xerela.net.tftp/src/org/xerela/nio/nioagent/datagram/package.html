This package contains classes that provide support for the NIO agent framework
specific to datagram (UDP) transport.  The bases of datagram communication in
Java NIO is the DatagramChannel.  The classes in this package typically contain
DatagramChannels as member fields.  The chief vehicle for communicating with the
underlying NIO agent framework is through implementing the KeyAttachement
interface.  Most of the classes in this package implement that interface.
DatagramAttachment forms the basis of datagram communication after the session
has been estrablished between the client and server.  This communication takes
place on a high port, not the well-known port of the server.  The
ServerDatagramAttachment binds to the well-known server port for the protocol
and accepts the initial packets from prospective clients.  After successfulling 
receiving a packet from a client, the ServerDatagramAttachment creates a new 
DatagramAttachment (and in turn a new DatagramChannel) specific to that client
connection and connects it to the clients socket address.  The remaining
transfer, including the initial response packet from the server, uses the newly
created high-port DatagramChannel.  The ClientDatagramChannel support client
communication by sending the initial request packet to the server on the
well-known port.  After it receives the initial response from the server
(presumably with the source port being a high port) it connects its underlying
DatagramChannel to the servers socket address.  At the point at which the server
datagram code and the client datagram code are using a connected
DatagramChannel, all higher-level codec/protocol code can be common (for the
packet types that are applicable to both server and client).
